# Implementation Tracker

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. Set up Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN/UI (SETUP-002)
2. Initial project setup and documentation review (SETUP-001)

### üöß In-Progress Tasks
1. Configure Supabase for authentication and database (SETUP-003)

### ‚è≥ Next-Up Tasks
1. Create basic simulation flow UI components (UI-001)

## Implementation Tracking Table

| Task ID | Description | Status | Owner | Dependencies | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|--------------|-------|
| SETUP-001 | Project Documentation Review | Completed | AI PM | None | Documentation reviewed and synchronized |
| SETUP-002 | Next.js Project Setup | Completed | Dev | None | Successfully set up Next.js 13+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and ShadcN/UI |
| SETUP-003 | Supabase Integration | Not Started | Dev | SETUP-002 | Auth and Database setup |
| UI-001 | Main Simulation Flow UI | Not Started | Dev | SETUP-002 | Following wireframe from MVP-idea.md |

## Critical Technical Risks

1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Implementing dynamic AI feedback system
   - Mitigation: Start with simple rule-based responses, gradually enhance with OpenRouter API

2. **Simulation Data Structure**
   - Risk: Designing flexible schema for various simulation types
   - Mitigation: Begin with fixed business strategy scenarios, make schema extensible

3. **Real-time Progress Tracking**
   - Risk: Performance impact of frequent progress updates
   - Mitigation: Implement basic progress tracking first, optimize later

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Current | Use Next.js 13+ | Better performance, built-in features | Vite + React Router |
| Current | Start with Business Strategy domain | Clear scenario structure, text-based | Coding, Language Learning |
| Current | ShadCN/UI for components | Modern, customizable, matches tech stack | MUI, Chakra UI |

## Acceptance Criteria for Next 3 Tasks

1. **Project Setup (SETUP-002)**
   - Next.js 13+ project initialized with App Router
   - Tailwind CSS and ShadCN/UI configured
   - Basic project structure following Next.js best practices

2. **Supabase Integration (SETUP-003)**
   - Authentication setup with email and OAuth
   - Database tables created for users and simulations
   - Environment variables configured

3. **Main Simulation Flow UI (UI-001)**
   - Implement wireframe components from MVP-idea.md
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Basic navigation between simulation steps

## Critical Questions

1. Should we implement dark mode in the initial MVP? 
Answer: No, MVP will focus on light mode.
2. What is the expected response time for AI feedback?
Answer: Will start with simple rule-based responses, gradually enhance with OpenRouter API
3. Should we support multiple languages in the MVP?
Answer: No, MVP will focus on English.

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Next.js project with required dependencies
2. Set up Supabase project and configure auth
3. Create basic UI components for simulation flow
